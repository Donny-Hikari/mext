@import variables from a file.
File ends with 'yaml' or 'json' will automatically be loaded as an object. When 'as' clause is present, the object will be loaded as a variable.
```
{@import "import.yaml" as imported}
{@format json imported}
```

If no 'as' clause is given, first level members of the object will be loaded into the local namespace.
```
{@import "import.yaml"}
{imported_var}
```

Other file type will be loaded as a string variable. Note you must specify the 'as' clause in this case.
Loaded from "default.mext":
```
{@import "default.mext" as default_mext}
{default_mext}
```

Using variable as filename is also possible.
Loaded from "set.mext":
```
{@import imported.set_mext_fn as set_mext}
{set_mext}
```
