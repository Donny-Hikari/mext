# Mext

Mext is a text template language that is useful for creating prompts for LLM.

The main target of Mext is to enable readable and powerful prompt templates for LLM (large language model).
But it is not limited to LLM. Mext also provide human friendly but powerful templates to producing texts.

This README is written with Mext. Source file: [readme_src/README.mext](readme_src/README.mext).

### Early Stage

The Mext language is still in its early stage.
New syntaxes may be introduced and broken changes might be made.

## Installation

Use the following command to install mext.

```bash
$ pip install mext-lang
```

## Development

To build and install mext from scratch, clone this repository and use `make`.

The default target of make will perform testing, cleanup previous build, and install Mext.

```bash
$ make
```

To perform tests, use:

```bash
$ make test
```

You may as well use pip to install an editable version directly:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

## Render Mext file

You can render a Mext file handly with [mext/scripts/render_mext.py](mext/scripts/render_mext.py).

Usage:

```bash
$ python -m mext.scripts.render_mext readme_src/README.mext -o README.md
```

Or, if you installed mext, the render script will be installed automatically:

```bash
$ render-mext readme_src/README.mext -o README.md
```

To render this README.md with make:

```bash
$ make README.md
```

This will also render the data file [readme_src/README.yaml](readme_src/README.yaml) from [readme_src/README-yaml.mext](readme_src/README-yaml.mext) and [readme_src/README-yaml.yaml](readme_src/README-yaml.yaml).

## Usage as a template language

{@include "template_language_usage.mext" syntaxes=syntaxes, is_standalone=false}

## Syntax

Note although the @import syntax is used in most of the examples in this section, in production it is more often that variables are passed to `Mext.compose` as parameters directly. Check out the section [Usage as a template language](<#usage-as-a-template-language>) as well.

{@comment} As "README.yaml" is @import in "template_language.mext" and "syntax.mext", passing `syntaxes=syntaxes` is not necessary. {@endcomment}
{@include "syntax.mext" is_standalone=false}
